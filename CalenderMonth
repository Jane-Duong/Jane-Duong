/* You are programming a simple utility that identifies the meteorological season based on the calendar month and hemisphere entered by the user.
The program asks for the hemisphere (N for North, S for South), asks for the month as a number (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.), 
and then displays the corresponding meteorological season.
Note: From now on, NH stands for Northern Hemisphere, and SH stands for Southern Hemisphere.
For this program, assume:
Winter (NH), Summer (SH): Dec-Feb
Spring (NH), Fall (SH): Mar-May
Summer (NH), Winter (SH): Jun- Aug
Fall (NH), Spring (SH): Sep-Nov
If the user enters an invalid hemisphere character, display the message "Please enter a valid hemisphere (N - S)." 
If the user enters a number less than 1 or greater than 12 for the month, display the message "Please enter a valid month number (1 - 12)." /*
